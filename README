Stepper Motor Control

Warning
=======
There is currently no soft stop for movements that go beyond the range of any
particular setup. As a result, if one enters a distance to move that puts
whatever the stepper motor drives into a position of danger, damage to person
and property may result. Always double check measurements and clearance before
making a movement.

Usage
=====
This program is meant to be used in conjunction with the complementary Arduino
code that controls the stepper motor itself. The control program communicates
via serial link. The Arduino is assumed to be the first Serial connected device.

Distance can be given in inches or centimeters. Currently, the program assumes
a 20 threads/inch rod.

Repetitions refers to the number of times a motion is repeated between the
current position and the entered distance.

Delay specifies the amount of time, in seconds, to wait in between repititions.
If no repititions are specified, this delay refers to the amount of time before
performing the initial movement.

"Clockwise" in this sense refers to the spindle rotation when looking at the
stepper motor from the rear.

Accuracy
========
Conversions are performed for the distance units. Because the threaded rods are
measured in inches, entering a metric unit can come with some loss of exact
precision.

With the current settings, each step is 1.8 degrees. This gives a resolution of
0.00025".

Timing resolution works best when limited to milliseconds. Most Arduino boards
have microsecond granularity (down to 4 musec on most, 8musec on smaller units).
Thus, the delay feature will work when supplied with numbers precise down to
the millionth of a second, but note two caveats:
1) The microsecond timer resets roughly every 70 minutes, leading to potentially
inaccurate measurements.
2) Straight from the Arduino documentation:
   "Currently, the largest value that will produce an accurate delay is 16383."
